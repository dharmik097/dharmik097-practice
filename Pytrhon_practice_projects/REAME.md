Sure! Here's a `README.md` file that clearly explains your currency conversion optimizer script. It includes usage instructions, dependencies, algorithm descriptions, and example output.

```markdown
# 💱 Currency Conversion Optimizer

This Python script finds the **best way to convert money from one currency to another** using multiple smart algorithms. It checks whether you get a better rate directly, or by converting through intermediate currencies like USD or EUR.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 💰 Compares multiple conversion strategies:
  - **Normal Strategy** (Direct & 1-hop)
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (Shortest path via any number of steps)
  - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** (All possible paths + loop detection)
- 📈 Prints a console bar graph comparing exchange rate effectiveness
- ⏳ Shows a loading animation for better UX
- ✅ Recommends the best strategy for maximum value
- 🔌 Uses **open source API** (no login or API key needed)

---

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed.  
Install the required package with:

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔹 1. Normal Strategy

Checks:
- Direct conversion (`INR -> EUR`)
- All 1-hop conversions (`INR -> USD -> EUR`, `INR -> JPY -> EUR`)

Returns the best rate among them.

---

### 🔹 2. Dijkstra's Strategy

- Treats currencies as nodes and rates as edges (with inverted cost).
- Finds the **lowest cost path** using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- Good when the best conversion goes through multiple currencies.

---

### 🔹 3. Bellman-Ford Strategy

- Explores **every possible combination of currencies**.
- Works well in detecting **optimal or hidden paths**.
- Slower, but handles tricky scenarios better than Dijkstra sometimes.

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. Run the script:

```bash
python currency_optimizer.py
```

2. Enter the base and target currencies:

```
🔹 From Currency (e.g., INR):
🔹 To Currency (e.g., EUR):
```

3. Wait for the loading animation and results.

🔹 From Currency (e.g., INR): INR
🔹 To Currency (e.g., EUR): EUR

Processing exchange data... ⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳ ✅

[Normal Strategy]
Best path: INR -> USD -> EUR = 0.013645

[Dijkstra Strategy]
Best path: INR -> GBP -> EUR
Effective rate: 0.013751

[Bellman-Ford Strategy]
Path: INR -> GBP -> USD -> EUR
Effective rate: 0.013912

-------------------------------
Exchange Path Comparison:
Normal          ██████████████ 0.013645
Dijkstra        ████████████████ 0.013751
Bellman-Ford    ███████████████████ 0.013912

✅ Recommended Strategy: Bellman-Ford
➡️  Path: INR -> GBP -> USD -> EUR
💰 Best Rate: 0.013912

## 🌐 Currency Rates API

This script uses the [Open Exchange Rates API](https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest) (free & public, no key required).

## 🧩 Ideas for Future Features

- GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
- Save and export best path as a file
- Track historical rates and trends
- Multi-currency comparison (not just pairwise)
